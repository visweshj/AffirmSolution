The runnable distribution is packed as AffirmSolution.jar. The jar by default has the small input files included in the distribution in them.

Once the distribution is executed the library generates two output files (assignments.csv & yields.csv) in the same directory as where the distribution is kept at.


To Run the distribution: 

JDK Requirements: JDK 16
